# Lesson 8 takeaways 
- spend time getting bounding box coordinates into useable format 
- first step - write functions to display data and annotations to allow fast exploration 
- use dictionary comprehensions
- use `imageclassifierdata.from_csv`
- to create bounding box model 1. create model with 4 continuous outputs 2. create loss functions that
is lower is those 4 outputs are near to 4 other numbers
- PathLib JSON
- Defaultdict
- Lambda function
